# Preparing for the Leadership Role

- **Transition to Leadership**
  - Moving from an individual contributor to a leadership role involves a significant shift, focusing on team performance rather than individual achievements.

- **Understanding New Responsibilities**
  - Set up time with your manager to clarify your new responsibilities and understand the expectations in your leadership role.

- **Learning to Let Go**
  - Realize that perfection in every detail, such as reviewing all code, may not be part of your role. Learning to trust your team's abilities is crucial.

- **Delegation Skills**
  - Delegating tasks is essential for effective leadership. Acknowledge different methods to achieve tasks and trust your team's capabilities.

- **Seeking Help and Training**
  - Accept assistance from your manager or a professional coach, especially in delegation skills.
  - Enroll in trainings offered by your company for new managers to understand management policies and responsibilities better.

- **Being Kind to Yourself**
  - Leadership is a marathon, not a sprint. It's okay not to have all the answers immediately or to solve every problem right away.

- **Leadership Qualities**
  - Successful leaders are authentic, positive, continuously learning, and confident.
  - Embrace the confidence to involve the right team members in finding solutions.

- **Continuous Growth**
  - Give yourself time to adapt to the new role and ask for help when needed. Being open to learning and growth is key to becoming an effective leader.
