# Always Be Hiring

- **Importance of Continuous Hiring**
  - As a new manager, achieving early wins is crucial, requiring the right team and resources.
  - Often, resources are limited, and the existing team may be stretched thin, underscoring the need for constant recruitment.

- **Challenges of Last-Minute Hiring**
  - Waiting until there's an immediate need can lead to prolonged vacancies and missed targets.

- **Proactive Hiring Strategies**
  - **Skill List:** Maintain a list of skills needed for future hires based on your team's growth and expansion plans.
  - **Utilize Social Media:** Use platforms like LinkedIn to signal hiring needs well before job requisitions are formally opened.
  - **Networking:** Leverage your professional network, keeping in touch with former colleagues and monitoring their career progress for potential future opportunities.
  - **Conference Outreach:** Announce hiring intentions when speaking at conferences, inviting interested parties to connect.
  - **Pre-Interview Discussions:** Engage with potential candidates early to gauge interest and fit, even before job positions are officially posted.
  - **Recruiter Collaboration:** If someone doesn't fit the current opening but has valuable skills, refer them to recruiters for other opportunities within the organization.

- **Balancing Skill and Cultural Fit**
  - Recognizing that not every skilled candidate will be the right cultural fit for your team is vital in the hiring process.

- **Networking and Authenticity**
  - It's acceptable and beneficial to reach out to your network about future hiring plans, emphasizing authenticity and a genuine desire to explore mutual fit.

- **Benefits of Always Hiring**
