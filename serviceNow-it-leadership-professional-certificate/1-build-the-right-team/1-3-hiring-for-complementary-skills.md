# Hiring for Complementary Skills

- **Realigning Team Goals**
  - As a new leader, adapting the team to meet new goals may require acquiring new skill sets not currently present within the team.

- **Common Hiring Misconceptions**
  - Technical teams often prioritize technical skills, even for roles that don't necessitate them, overlooking candidates who possess the right non-technical skills for the job.

- **Case Study: Certification Manager Hiring**
  - Faced with the goal of onboarding 100,000 customers, a clear gap was identified in the team's expertise in creating certification programs.
  - The initial inclination was to hire someone with technical skills, though the role demanded skills in creating certification blueprints and leading workshops, not coding.

- **Identifying Skill Gaps**
  - **Skill Matrix Creation:** Documenting each team member's skills through regular one-on-ones helps in understanding the team's capabilities and identifying gaps.
  - **List Required Skills:** Define primary and secondary skills needed to achieve team goals, comparing them against the team's current skill set to find gaps.

- **Decision Making: Hiring vs. Internal Development**
  - Assess whether to hire externally to quickly fill the skill gap or to develop someone internally, considering time constraints, budget, and internal interest.

- **Example Outcome**
  - Although an internal team member was interested in the certification manager role, the significant skill gap and time constraints led to an external hire.
  - Partnering the new hire with the interested team member facilitated skill development and the successful launch of the certification program, benefiting the entire team.

- **Leadership Responsibility**
  - Ensuring the team possesses the necessary skills for success is a key leadership role. This may involve hiring for complementary skills to address any gaps, rather than duplicating existing skills.
