# Integrating Your Team with the Business

- **Alignment Challenges**
  - Misalignment often occurs in meetings where engineering and business teams do not see eye to eye.
  - The business team may feel the tech team lacks business perspective, while the tech team struggles to communicate their perspective to the business team.

- **Strategies for Alignment**
  - **Articulate Meeting Goals:** A crucial step to realign is to pause and clarify the goal of any meeting. This ensures everyone understands their contribution towards the goal, facilitating smoother conversations.
  - **Understand Business Goals:** As a leader, ensure your team comprehends the business goals and can articulate their work in relation to these goals.
  - **Stakeholder Alignment:** It's vital for the team to understand how their work and their stakeholders' work align with the business objectives.
  - **Project and Goal Convergence:** Teams should see how their projects contribute to the organizational goals to create synergy.

- **Practical Examples**
  - Developers should understand how writing code (be it 50 or 100 lines) aligns with business objectives.
  - Tech teams need to communicate project statuses and updates in a way that ties back to business goals, ensuring business teams can process and understand the relevance of the technical information.

- **Leadership Responsibility**
  - As a tech leader, it is your responsibility to coach your team on crafting communications (emails, conversations) that highlight how their work aligns with business goals.
