# Introduction to KPIs

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are metrics used to measure individual contributions towards a team's overall goal. They foster accountability and trust within the team by making clear how each member contributes to the team's objectives.

## Creating KPIs

- Begin by defining clear objectives for each team member.
- Establish measurement criteria and set a duration for the measurement period.

Example: For a team goal of acquiring 50 reference customers in a year, KPIs for different roles might vary according to their responsibilities.

### KPI for Training Managers

- **Objective:** Increase the number of trained customers to 100.
- **Rationale:** Trained customers are more likely to adopt the service fully, leading to a higher likelihood of them becoming reference customers.
- **Measurement:** Track the number of customers enabled during training sessions.
- **Strategy:** Enroll all newly acquired customers in a day-long training on using the service.
- **Responsibility:** The training manager.
- **Review Cadence:** Monthly.

### KPI for Technical Product Managers

- **Objective:** Reduce the customer onboarding time to one week.
- **Rationale:** Faster onboarding results in happier customers, who are then more willing to become reference customers.
- **Measurement:** Monitor the number of days spent onboarding each customer.
- **Strategy:** Collaborate with the sales team to create a comprehensive onboarding plan as soon as services are sold.
- **Responsibility:** The product manager.
- **Review Cadence:** Monthly.

## Guidelines for KPI Creation

- Aim for three to five KPIs per individual to ensure focused and manageable objectives.
- Align KPIs closely with the team's overall goal to drive collective effort and engagement.
- Establish a regular review process to monitor progress and adjust strategies as needed.
